# MailBuilder

Coming very soon... a custom web app for rapid and pain-free responsive email creation. It's the un-WYSIWYG.

Created with Handlebars.js and a lot of love, MailBuilder will allow you to create your own email template components and string together on the fly without worrying about a WYSIWYG messing up your precious code. Non-technical users will be able to crank out amazing responsive emails in no time flat.

Watch this repo for updates coming soon.

For more information and a presentation I recently gave about responsive email, see [Demystifying Responsive Email](http://www.peteranglea.com/presentations/demystifying-responsive-email/).
